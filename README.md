# Angular App

This Angular app fetches data from JSONPlaceholder, a free fake REST API for testing and prototyping, and displays it on the home page. Users can click on each item to view more details.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval:** The app utilizes the `HttpClient` module provided by Angular to make HTTP requests to the JSONPlaceholder API.
- **Home Page Display:** The fetched data is displayed on the home page using Angular's `ngFor` directive to iterate over the items.
- **Details View:** Users can click on each item to navigate to a details view where additional information about the item is displayed.

1. **Clone the repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
